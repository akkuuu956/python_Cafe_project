# python_Cafe_project
This Python notebook implements a class called PythonCafeTalk to model a cafe menu and ordering system.

Key points:

- The __init__ method prints out branding info for the cafe and a menu of available cuisine types (Indian, German, Korean, Chinese)

- There are separate methods for each cuisine type (german(), korean(), etc) which define food items and prices, print a menu dataframe, take user input to select/quantity items and calculate totals including 5% service tax.

- The main block creates an instance of PythonCafeTalk, takes user input to select a cuisine, and calls the appropriate cuisine method to handle that order.

- It demonstrates OOP concepts like:
  - Encapsulating data and logic together into a class 
  - Using methods to expose limited interface to users
  - Storing lists/dicts as attributes to represent menu items  
  - Using inheritance from parent class to specialize behaviors

Overall, this provides a basic model for taking and processing food orders at a restaurant point-of-sale type system. Some ways it could be improved:

- Add parameters to the cuisine type methods to customize at call time
- Implement ordering/total logic in one common method instead of separate per cuisine
- Store the menu items/prices in a separate DB table 
- Add options for ordering multiples, cancelling items
- Integrate with payment APIs, printing logic etc.
